<span class="i0">Ye shores of England, as ye fast recede<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The pain of parting rends my weary breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must regret&mdash;yet there is little need<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That I should mourn, for only wild unrest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is mine while in my native land I roam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou gav'st me birth, but cannot give a home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">It could not be that that bright sun would shine<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For many months, and while its light was new<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clouds arose, and, in one fated day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jealous storm had swept my joys away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i8">III.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That fated day, when I believed that all<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The hopes that I had cherished in the past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would be fulfilled, and I should fondly call<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The being whom I loved my own at last:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fell the storm, and bursting on my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still saved my body when my soul was dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i8">IV.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I loved her dearly, and my heart was set<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On winning her. My only aim in life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was to secure her love, and so forget<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The world beside&mdash;my world would be my wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never loved another, her alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loved, and, loving, longed to call my own.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i8">V.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The summer months were passed in tortured bliss.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My love had grown, but that it could not grow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It all-enveloped me, and one sweet kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From her dear lips had made my bosom glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With happiness; and many months of pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been as nothing, that one kiss to gain.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, when the many-tinted Autumn's reign<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Succeeded Summer's more congenial sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I told her of the mingled joy and pain<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That stirred my soul throughout each Summer's day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whispered, in emotion's softest tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love that I had feared before to own.<br /></span>

<span class="i8">VII.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She listened silently, then, sweetly shy,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She laid her gentle head upon my breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in the liquid depths of each blue eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I read the love her lips had not confessed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quickly, fondly, pressed her to my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vowing that none should keep us two apart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Ah! happy were the months that followed then,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The months that flew as rapidly as days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet the stolen hours of meeting when<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We listened to the nightingale's sad lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, seated on a rustic bench alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgot all else in glad communion.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had not asked her father for her hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He was a baronet of ancient blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud of his lineage, jealous of his land;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His pride was such as boded me no good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was an author, not unknown to fame,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">My love to him, and ask for his consent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He loved her well, and could not fail to bless<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our union; his pride had oft unbent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her, and she had now but little fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he would hear me with a willing ear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i8">XI.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I gladly heard her speak in confident<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That had been mine now vanished, and I went,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With lightsome heart, to seek her father out:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prayed him give his daughter for my wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus confer a blessing on my life.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He heard me silently, nor did he speak<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For full two minutes after I had ceased;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, while his eye flashed, and his livid cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Betrayed his passion, was his tongue released;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in vituperative tones, he swore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should never cross his threshold more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i8">XIII.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Was this my gratitude for patronage,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That I should thus inveigle his one daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seek to supplement my sorry wage<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By the rich dowry that her marriage brought her?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a baronet of ancient name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No parvenu his daughter's hand should claim.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i8">XIV.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His words enraged me, but I checked my wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For her dear sake, whose love alone that fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could quench, and mildly arguments put forth<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To soothe the baronet, and calm his ire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But useless all the arguments I wove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In foaming rage he cursed me and my love.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What need to speak of all that next ensued?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Still constantly, throughout those weary days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impelled by hope, with fondest love imbued,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Did I renew my suit. By bold essays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought to win the baronet's consent&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Behind her father's house. In pain she wrote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, though the letter spoke no word of pain,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And kissed the cheeks that told so sad a tale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sadly smiled, then spoke, her cheek bedewed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The while, with bitter tears again renewed:<br /></span>

<span class="i1"><b>THE HIDDEN PURPOSE.</b><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was weary and faint with temptation and trial,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the prayers I had made had but met with denial,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the slow-coming doubt, which had once hardly found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my heart a mean place, was now strong and profound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And my soul was in anguish, for suffering keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And intense disappointment, too often had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New prepared for my portion, till now, as I lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By new sorrow re-stung, all my faith passed away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then a curse on my lips rose, and darkly I swore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the God who had led me should lead me no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His existence was doubtful, but, if He should be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had been but a God of vindiction to me.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So I vowed that henceforward the path that I trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should be chosen by me, and not ordered by God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And relief seemed to greet my resolve as I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in sleeplessness, waiting the breaking of day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But as quiet I lay, and thought o'er my decision,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All my wakefulness passed, and I saw in a vision,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By my side standing closely, an Angel of Light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in shining apparel resplendently bright.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I lay there all trembling in fear as I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till with beckoning finger he led me away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I rose and went forth in the darkness of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, still trembling, I followed that Angel of Light.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I followed him on till he paused in his flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where a Christian lay sleeplessly passing the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I heard him repeat as he lay on his bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My paths are divided, Lord, which shall I tread?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I saw that the one led to glory and fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the other fulfilled not his heart-cherished aim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the scales of mortality darkened his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thing I saw plainly he could not descry.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the Angel breathed o'er him, and light seemed to break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er his soul, and he saw then the path he should take.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then his spirit was eased, and sweet sleep o'er him came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he thought this would lead him to glory and fame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But I saw that the path he had chosen that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would lead him from glory and fame far away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I saw, too, that, were he not led in this path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love of the world would have shaken his faith.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For his pride, swelling high in the glory of gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would have led him from God to things sinful and vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his trouble would lead him to God now for rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I saw that the plan of his Maker was best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the Angel went forth, and I followed him still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus impelled by the force of his Heavenly will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he stayed where two lovers stood breathing their vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the fondness that love and deep passion arouse.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he put forth his hand, and he pointed in wrath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fever-fiend rose with a horrible laugh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the man felt him not as he poisoned his blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the woman saw nought as still smiling she stood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But I knew that that meeting was surely their last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the shadow of death on the man was now cast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my heart could but pity the woman, whose pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I yet knew would redound to her infinite gain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For deception and falsity deep in the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the man were writ large, and there truth had no part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pain of her mourning was nought when compared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the agony he would have caused her, if spared.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quickly onward then hasted the Angel of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I still followed close in the steps that he trod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I saw, when his flight was arrested again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we stood where an infant lay tossing in pain.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the mother, with tear-laden eyes, kneeling there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought relief from her trouble in heart-broken prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she cried unto God, in a piteous tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That He would not deny her the life of her son.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the Angel himself breathed a sorrowful sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I thought that a tear glistened bright in his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he stretched forth his hand, and commanded the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the child to ascend to its Heavenly goal.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I heard a loud cry of distress on the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I saw the lone mother lie grief-stricken there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tears of compassion flowed fast from my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I knew that God's action was kindly and wise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For disease on the child had imprinted its stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his life would have been but a long-endured pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had his Father not early exerted His might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus called the young soul to the Kingdom of Light.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the scene seemed to melt in the darkness away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again on the couch in my chamber I lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Angel of God by my side again stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he gazed on me sadly and said, "God is good."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I saw him no more, but with morn I awoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And remembered the words that the Angel had spoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the scenes of the vision, repictured again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed before me, and brought me a balm for my pain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For I knew that my God had not called me in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To temptation and trial, and I would not complain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with gladness I went forth anew to the strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing now that my Father was guiding my life.<br /></span>

<span class="i3">But I've seen it illumed with a mischievous light,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Which the sparkles displayed in the meteor's flight<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Cannot meet, as her laughter reverberates round,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And merrily echo responds to the sound.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Declare her woman more than child,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet mark her innocence.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But I've heard her repeating the quip or the joke,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">While merriment shone in her eyes as she spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">As, with skill that is seldom excelled on the stage,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She worthily mimicked the actor or sage.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">In look, in voice, in act displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Must bring her love and praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But I know that when nimbly she's tripping the dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When her eyes sparkle bright with a mischievous glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When her sallies of innocent wit shall outpour,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She will capture the hearts that were callous before.<br /></span>
